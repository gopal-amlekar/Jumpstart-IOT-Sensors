### Sensors and Actuators interfacing with Raspberry Pi and IOTIFY

This repository contains sample code for interfacing various sensors and actuators such as motors.

#### Sensors

* HC-SR04 - Ultrasonic distance measurement sensor
* SHT-21 - Temperature and Humidity measurement sensor
* APDS9301 - Lux level sensor
* ADS1115 - 4-Channel ADC
* BMP180 - Temperature and Barometric Pressure Sensor module

#### Actuators

* Servo motor
* Stepper motor with DRV8834

_Note: Servo motor is not available in IOTIFY._
